1,0.70606524,Medium,"The toxicological  mechanisms  
of MOF-199  were attributed  to oxidative  stress, which further led to the membrane  damage and DNA damage."
2,0.7228703,Medium,"Our results indicated  that MOF-199  
was of low toxicity and environmental  risks to bacteria."
3,0.70892066,Medium,"Beyond  the successful  achievements,  the hazards  and toxicity  of MOF 
materials  should be systematically  evaluated  to ensure their safe appli- 
cations ( Sajid, 2016 )."
4,0.7841402,Medium,"The toxicity  and safety of MOF materials  have aroused  the concerns  
of the community,  but the toxicological  data of MOF materials  are still 
seldom reported  in literature."
5,0.7716891,Medium,"MOF materials  showed  low toxicity  to 
mammalian  cells ( Yen et al., 2016 ; Chen et al., 2019 ; Lin et al., 2016 ; 
Hu et al., 2014 )."
6,0.8484875,High,"Similarly,  the in vivo studies 
suggested  that MOF accumulated  in body and induced  low toxicity  to 
animals  ( Destefani  et al., 2016 )."
7,0.7692694,Medium,"The toxico- 
logical mechanism  and chemical  origin of MOF toxicity  are still largely 
unknown  and require  further investigations."
8,0.7320057,Medium,"The toxicity  of 
MOF-199  was studied  by growth  curve, colony-forming  unit (CFU) 
count, cell death rate and ultrastructure."
9,0.7117133,Medium,"All aforementioned  characterization  data collectively  indi- 
cated that MOF-199  was successfully  synthesized  for toxicological  eval- 
uations  ( Hamon  et al., 2010 ; Solanky  and Haydel,  2012..."
10,0.7130202,Medium,"Toxicity  of MOF-199  to bacteria  
Since the toxicity  data of MOF was scarce, a large concentration  
range from 1-1200 ùúág/mL was preliminarily  evaluated  before the toxico- 
logical assays."
11,0.71640855,Medium,"The toxicity  of MOF-199  was Ô¨Årst monitored  by measuring  the 
OD 600 during the incubation  ( Fig."
12,0.8441273,High,"This suggested  that the cellular  uptake of 
MOF should be carefully  considered  in their toxicological  evaluations."
13,0.70342857,Medium,"Oxidative  stress was regarded  
as the toxicological  mechanism  of MOF-199."
14,0.71741104,Medium,"These 
results suggested  that MOF-199  was of low toxicity  to some speciÔ¨Åc  en- 
vironment."
15,0.72704476,Medium,"Pharmacokinetic evaluations also indi-cate that the MOF (Fe) nanoparticles could be easily excreted out of the body (Figure S16, Supporting Information), further 
evidencing the high biocompatibility ..."
16,0.7385117,Medium,"The toxicity demonstrated by the EuDOBDC-NP isequal to or signi Ô¨Åcantly lower than the toxicity of many other
nanoscale MOF formulations currently being developed for
biological imaging or drug delive..."
